What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initializing the repository creates a hidden file called .git.  To use git
version control, you need that file.  It contains configuration data and also
would be where the previous versions of your files reside - I think.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do yo think it offers?

The staging area acts as a intermediary so that you have a chance to edit
which files you've selected for a particular commit.  The working directory
contains all the files and can have uncommitted files in it.  The repository is
everything that is committed...?  Actually I'm a little unclear about the difference
between the working directory and repo.  I think the working directory is also the
repository.
